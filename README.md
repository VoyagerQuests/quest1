# 🧭 Quest 1 — Build the Character API  
## Episode 1: Entering the Realm of Clean Architecture

Welcome to **Quest 1, Episode 1**.  
In this quest, we focus on **building a working foundation**—getting the Character API up and running before refining structure and design in later parts.

### ⚙️ Create the Project Using `uv`

#### 1️⃣ Verify `uv` is installed

Run:

``` bash
uv --version
```

If you do **not** see a version number, install `uv` by following the
official instructions:\
👉 https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2️⃣ Recreate the project environment

From the project root (where `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` exist), run:

``` bash
uv sync
```

This will create the virtual environment and install all dependencies
exactly as locked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3️⃣ Start the FastAPI development server

``` bash
uv run fastapi dev
```

This runs the application using the synced environment---no manual
activation required.
Once the project is running you can access the docs at:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
